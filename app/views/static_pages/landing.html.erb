    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The Dynasty Trade Machine is a tool that can be used to help GMs make data-driven decisions when evaluating assets in dynasty format fantasy football leagues.</p>
    <p>The calculator allows an overview of the value being exchanged for up to 5 players per team. Insert the player names and the results will show the value both teams are getting along with who, according to ADP, the trade is in favor of.</p>
    <p>Managing your team over multiple seasons is what makes "dynasty" fantasy football. Asset management is key to success, and draft picks are vital to long term success. The machine estimates the value of 2015 draft picks, as well as future 1st-3rd picks. To search for 2015 picks, search by overall pick number (i.e. "Pick 1" to "Pick 36"). Future draft picks can be entered for the first 3 rounds ("Future 1st", "Future 2nd", or "Future 3rd".</p>
    <p>Ultimately this is designed to show value being exchanged according to aggregate ADP. <strong>This is not intended to be used as the sole tool in a trade evaluation.</strong> Good trades take league structure, scoring format, player values, and many other things unique to that individual league into consideration.</p>
    <p>Now included is the ability to go through the data your own way. Search for players to see historical information about their ADP, including trends so you can see wh experts are buying and selling. Or look through the entire database.</p>
